## About me:
*My path to IT began with an interest in frontend development, because I believe that this is a promising direction that provides a lot of opportunities for development. In addition, there are many educational platforms and open sources for self-study. I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript in December 2021. My modest experience in programming shows that constant practice of writing code is needed. I am sure that a person should study and develop all his life in order to meet the trends of the time and be the best in his business. That's why I'm here now. And I am sure that my abilities, acquired new knowledge and skills will allow me to become an excellent frontend developer and get a job in a prestigious company.*

## Skills:
* **HTML** 
* **CSS** 
* **JavaScript** (Basic, OOP, DOM)
* **Git/GitHub**
* **Other** (Figma, Photopea)

## Code examples:
```javascript
function compareArrays(arr1, arr2) {
  return arr1.length === arr2.length && arr1.every((it, i) => it === arr2[i]);
}

function advancedFilter(arr) {
  return arr.filter(positiveNum => positiveNum > 0 && positiveNum % 3 === 0).map((item) => item * 10);
}
```

## About me:
*My path to IT began with an interest in frontend development, because I believe that this is a promising direction that provides a lot of opportunities for development. In addition, there are many educational platforms and open sources for self-study. I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript in December 2021. My modest experience in programming shows that constant practice of writing code is needed. I am sure that a person should study and develop all his life in order to meet the trends of the time and be the best in his business. That's why I'm here now. And I am sure that my abilities, acquired new knowledge and skills will allow me to become an excellent frontend developer and get a job in a prestigious company.*
